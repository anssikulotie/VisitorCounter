# Visitor Counter App

## Overview

The Visitor Counter App is a simple mobile application developed with React Native 
It features a counter that increments by 1 each time the user taps the screen. The app includes a reset button to manually set the counter back to 0 and uses AsyncStorage to persist the counter value across app reloads and device restarts.

## Features

- **Counter Increment**: Tap anywhere on the screen to increase the counter by 1.
- **Reset Button**: Reset the counter to 0 at any time using the reset button located at the bottom right corner of the screen.
- **Data Persistence**: Counter values are stored and retrieved from AsyncStorage, ensuring data persistence through app reloads and device restarts.
